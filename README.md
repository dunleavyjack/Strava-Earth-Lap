# VERY, VERY FAR

## About
Your activties, summed up. VERY, VERY FAR connects with your Strava account (one of the most popular social media platforms for running and cylcing) and compares your total activities with different distances. How many times have you run across the Earth? How close have gotten to the Moon? How many times have you run around a 400m track?

## Tech
Made with React, Redux, Bootstrap 5, and Strava OAuth2 Authentication. Designed in Figma and hosted with Vercel. Full code available here on GitHub.

## OAuth2 Authorization Flow
I wrote a tutorial for using the Strava OAuth2 flow that was published by Level Up Coding on Medium that you can find [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/add-strava-oauth2-login-to-your-react-app-in-15-minutes-6c92e845919e).
